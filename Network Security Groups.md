An important consideration for public IP address attached to resources in virtual networks, you'll see here within the overview of this public IP address that's attached to our VM, we've got the standard SKU, not the older basic SKU.
Importantly for this, that means if we try and access any resource behind a standard public IP address, it's not going to work by default, because we need to configure a network security group to actually allow that access 


it's not going to work

Network Security Groups have several default security rules that you can't actually edit or delete them. The only thing I can do is i can create new rules with a higher priority being a lower number to override them

So by default I've got that allow VNet connectivity inbound and outbound, I allow load balancery connectivity, and I also allow interent outbound, but otherwise you'll see I block everything else by default. So if you want something to be allowed you have to create an allow rule. And that's exactly what I'll do.

I'll create a rule that can allow us to remotely connect to that virtual machine

You'll see now that we've got that rule there. It's sitting at the top of the list because I have the lower number than the other ones, meaning this rule will take priority.

I'll go ahead and apply this NSG. Currently it's just a security guard that's doing nothing, it's got some rules but it's not been told to go and guard any areas. To do that, I'll have to associate this NSG, either to just the virtual machine network interface (NIC), or I could associate it to the subnet, and that's what I'll do.

That NSG is now ready to go, in fact if i now take a look at that virtual machine, vm1,  and look at the network interface card, you'll see I can get a breakdown of the NSG rules that apply to this virtual machine
So we do see that it applies.

We do see that inbound RDP is allowed, and that should mean that if i go back my RDP client, i can now connect

The NSG is up and working
